## [Application Versioning Guide](https://projects.aussiedev81.com/versioning-guide "https://projects.aussiedev81.com/versioning-guide")


This small project, while small and exceptionally simple, was conceived out of both boredom, and practicing my recently increasing love of JavaScript and CSS.

Semantic versioning is also something I question myself about on almost every project (and there are A LOT), so for me it's going to become a handy point of reference when incrementing my project.

I hope it's as useful to you as it is to me üòÅ

## [Age Calculator](https://projects.aussiedev81.com/age-calculator "https://projects.aussiedev81.com/age-calculator")


Another result of boredom over the holidays, this simple age calculator takes your date of birth as input, and displays your current age broken down into `Years`, `Months`, and `Days`.

In addition, a modal window will be displayed where a group of monkeys can sing and dance for you if it is your birthday.

While small and seemingly insignificant, this calculator just goes to show that my brain never completely relaxes üòÜ
