# Application Versioning Guide

This small project, while small and exceptionally simple, was conceived out of both boredom, and practicing my recently increasing love of JavaScript and CSS.

Semantic versioning is also something I question myself about on almost every project (and there are A LOT), so for me it's going to become a handy point of reference when incrementing my project.

I hope it's as useful to you as it is to me üòÅ
